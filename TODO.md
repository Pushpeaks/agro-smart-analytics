# TODO: Apply Spotify-Inspired Theme to AgroSmart Frontend

- [x] Update project title in App.js to "AgroSmart"
- [x] Modify inline styles in App.js for container, form, inputs, button, and report sections to match Spotify theme (dark background #191414, white/light gray text, green accent #1DB954, gray cards)
- [x] Update index.css to set global dark background (#191414) and white text for consistency
- [x] Optionally tweak App.css if needed (focus on App.js primary changes) - No changes needed
- [x] Test the app visually after changes - Styles applied successfully
- [x] Ensure responsiveness and readability - Grid layout and padding ensure responsiveness
